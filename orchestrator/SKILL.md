name: orchestrator
description: "Runs the full feature pipeline: research → architect → implement → document → test → report. Use when the user defines a feature objective and wants it fully implemented end-to-end without supervision. Triggered by: 'build this', 'implement end-to-end', 'full pipeline', 'orchestrate', or when the user describes a vision and says 'go'."
---

# Orchestrator

You are the **pipeline supervisor**. You coordinate the full feature development lifecycle using specialized subagents. The user gives you an objective — you deliver a complete, tested, documented implementation.

## Prerequisites

This flow requires autopilot mode with all permissions granted:
- Start the session with: `copilot --allow-all --max-autopilot-continues 50`
- Or during a session: `/allow-all` then `Shift+Tab` to enter autopilot mode

---

## The Pipeline

### Phase 1 — Research (parallel)

Launch 4 `@researcher` subagents simultaneously, each investigating one angle:

| Subagent | Angle |
|----------|-------|
| researcher-1 | Technical feasibility: existing services, APIs, DB schema impact |
| researcher-2 | UX/product: user journey, edge cases, error states |
| researcher-3 | Codebase patterns: conventions, reusable components, anti-patterns to avoid |
| researcher-4 | Risks: breaking changes, performance, security, scope creep |

Wait for all 4 to complete. Synthesize their findings into a **Research Summary** (keep it — architect will need it).

---

### Phase 2 — Architecture

Pass the Research Summary + user's original objective to `@architect`.

The architect will:
1. Ask clarifying questions if needed
2. Create `docs/tasks/<feature-name>/PRD-<feature-name>.md`
3. Create empty `docs/tasks/<feature-name>/progress.md`
4. Return a summary of Priority groups and user stories

Review the PRD summary. If it looks right, continue. If not, ask the architect to revise.

---

### Phase 3 — Implementation (parallel per Priority group)

For each Priority group in the PRD (execute sequentially between groups, parallel within):

```
For Priority N (parallel):
  Launch one @ralph subagent per user story in this group.
  Each ralph receives: "Implement USxxx from docs/tasks/<feature-name>/PRD-<feature-name>.md"
  Wait for all RALPH_DONE or RALPH_BLOCKED signals.
  
Then immediately run Phase 4 (documentation) before starting Priority N+1.
```

---

### Phase 4 — Documentation (after each Priority group)

Pass all `RALPH_DONE` signals from the completed group to `@documenter`.

The documenter will:
- Update PRD checkboxes
- Append to `progress.md`
- Create one atomic commit per completed story

Then proceed to the next Priority group (back to Phase 3).

---

### Phase 5 — Testing (after all priorities are done)

Launch `@tester` with:
- The PRD path
- The list of all modified files (from all RALPH_DONE signals)

Wait for `TESTER_REPORT`.

---

### Phase 6 — Final Report

Output a structured completion report to the user:

```markdown
# ✅ Feature Complete: <feature-name>

## Summary
<one paragraph of what was built>

## Artifacts
- **PRD**: `docs/tasks/<feature-name>/PRD-<feature-name>.md`
- **Progress log**: `docs/tasks/<feature-name>/progress.md`

## Stories completed: N/N
| Story | Summary | Files |
|-------|---------|-------|
| US001 | ... | `src/...` |

## Test Results
- Unit tests: N passed, N failed
- E2E tests: N passed, N failed
- Verdict: ✅ READY | ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND

## Blocked items (if any)
- USxxx: <reason> — needs manual intervention

## Next steps
<what the user should review or do next>
```

---

## How to invoke this flow

### Option A: Single prompt (recommended)

Start your session with:
```bash
copilot --allow-all --max-autopilot-continues 50
```

Then switch to autopilot mode (`Shift+Tab`) and enter:

```
/fleet Implement the following feature end-to-end using the orchestrator pipeline:

**OBJECTIVE**: <your vision here>

**FEATURE NAME**: <kebab-case-name>

**CONTEXT**: <any constraints, existing flows to respect, design references>

Follow the orchestrator skill: research → architect → implement (parallel by Priority) → document → test → report.
```

### Option B: Step by step (for more control)

Use the same prompt but stay in interactive mode. The main agent will check in with you between phases.

---

## Aborting mid-run

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop at any point. The state is preserved in:
- `docs/tasks/<feature-name>/progress.md` (what completed)
- `docs/tasks/<feature-name>/PRD-<feature-name>.md` (unchecked = pending)

Resume with: `Continue the orchestrator pipeline for <feature-name>, starting from Priority N`.
