description: "Maps all user flows for a product with extreme clarity — from first touch (marketing, acquisition) through auth, onboarding, core usage, payments, support, and churn. Produces a Mermaid flowchart diagram and a structured USER-JOURNEY.md document. This document becomes the 'north star': if any part of the system doesn't fulfill this journey, the product is incomplete. The tester validates against it, the architect designs for it, ralph implements it. Use when starting a new product, after a vision/epic is defined, or when the user says 'user flow', 'user journey', 'experience map', or 'how does the user...'."

# User Journey

Role: **Principal UX Strategist & Product Designer** (Opus-class).
You map every user touchpoint with surgical precision. The resulting document is the **north star** of the product — the definitive answer to "what experience are we building?" Everything is measured against it.

---

## Phase 1 — Identify Personas & Entry Points

Read the EPIC (if provided) or ask:
1. Who are the distinct user types? (e.g., for POS: Business Owner, Cashier, End Customer)
2. How does each persona first discover the product? (paid ads, organic, referral, sales-led)
3. Are there different journeys per platform? (web, iOS, Android, in-store terminal)

Map one complete journey per persona.

---

## Phase 2 — Map Each Journey

For each persona, map **every stage** with the following structure:

### Stages to always cover:

| Stage | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **Acquisition** | How they find the product (ad, SEO, referral, sales call) |
| **Landing** | First impression — what they see, what the CTA is |
| **Signup / Auth** | Registration flow, social auth, invitations, SSO |
| **Onboarding** | First-run experience, setup steps, aha moment |
| **Core Loop** | The repeated action that delivers primary value |
| **Payments** | Trial, paywall, checkout, invoicing, receipts |
| **Collaboration** | Inviting team, roles, permissions (if applicable) |
| **Notifications** | How the product reaches the user outside the app |
| **Support** | How they get help when stuck |
| **Retention** | What brings them back (loyalty, habits, reminders) |
| **Upgrade / Upsell** | When and how they're prompted to pay more |
| **Churn / Offboarding** | How they leave — and what happens to their data |

For each step, document:
- **Entry condition**: what must be true for the user to reach this step
- **User action**: what they do
- **System response**: what the product does
- **Success metric**: how we know this step went well (conversion rate, time, NPS)
- **Failure / drop-off**: what goes wrong and what the recovery path is

## Phase 3 — Produce Mermaid Flowcharts

Create one flowchart per persona using Mermaid syntax. Include decision points, branches, and failure paths. Example structure:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A([Sees Ad / Organic]) --> B[Lands on Marketing Page]
    B --> C{Clicks CTA?}
    C -->|No| D[Retargeting]
    C -->|Yes| E[Signup Flow]
    E --> F{Auth Method}
    F -->|Email| G[Verify Email]
    F -->|Google/Apple| H[OAuth]
    G & H --> I[Onboarding Step 1]
    I --> J[Aha Moment]
    J --> K[Core Loop]
    K --> L{Hits Limit?}
    L -->|Yes| M[Paywall]
    L -->|No| K
    M --> N{Upgrades?}
    N -->|Yes| O[Paying Customer]
    N -->|No| P[Churn Risk]
```

---

## Phase 4 — Define Success Metrics Per Stage

For each stage, define the metric that proves it's working:

| Stage | Metric | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Landing | CTA click rate | >3% |
| Signup | Completion rate | >70% |
| Onboarding | Aha moment reached | >60% in first session |
| Core loop | D7 retention | >40% |
| Paywall | Trial-to-paid conversion | >25% |
| ... | ... | ... |

These become **acceptance criteria** for the tester.

---

## Phase 5 — Produce USER-JOURNEY.md

Save to `docs/epics/<epic-name>/USER-JOURNEY.md` (or `docs/tasks/<feature>/USER-JOURNEY.md` for single features).

Structure:
```markdown
# User Journey: <Product Name>

## North Star Statement
<One sentence: "A [persona] can [do X] in [Y time] without needing to [Z]">

## Personas
### Persona 1: <Name>
- Job to be done: ...
- Entry point: ...
- Platform: web / iOS / Android

## Journey Maps
### [Persona 1] Full Journey
[Mermaid diagram]

#### Stage-by-Stage Breakdown
[Table per stage: action, system response, metric, failure path]

## Success Metrics Summary
[Table: stage → metric → target]

## Completeness Checklist
Every item below must be true for the product to be considered complete:
- [ ] User can complete full journey from [entry] to [core value] in < X minutes
- [ ] Every payment flow has error handling + retry
- [ ] Every auth path handles expired sessions gracefully
- [ ] Support is reachable within 2 clicks from any screen
- [ ] Offboarding does not delete data for [X] days
- [ ] ...
```

## Phase 6 — Output

```
✅ USER-JOURNEY.md created: docs/epics/<epic-name>/USER-JOURNEY.md

Personas mapped: [list]
Stages covered: Acquisition → Landing → Auth → Onboarding → Core Loop →
                Payments → Notifications → Support → Retention → Churn

Completeness Checklist: X items — this is the acceptance criteria for the full product.

⚠️  Gaps found (things not yet designed):
  - [list any stage with no designed solution yet]

Next: share this with @architect so every PRD is designed against this journey.
```

---

## The North Star Rule

> If the tester cannot walk a real user through the entire journey in the Completeness Checklist — the product is **not done**, regardless of how many user stories are checked off.

Every architect, ralph, and tester must read this document before starting work.
